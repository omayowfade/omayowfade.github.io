										<p style="font-size: 150%">
											Signing up for AP Computer Science during my senior year of high school marked the inception of my programming interests.
					            Although the idea of computer science intrigued me, I had no idea what to expect walking into class for the first time.
					            Already loaded up on my desktop was Alice 2D, an archaic scene-based graphic software. Interweaving models and actions
					            together in a landscape, I spent the next hour programming characters to walk, jump, and ultimately come to life in my
					            fantastically constructed scenes. Before I knew it, I fell in love with programming.

									<p style="font-size: 150%">
				            My love for programming only proliferated from thereon. Throughout senior year, I frequented coding practice websites
				            such as CodingBat to bolster my Java skillset. The following summer before college, I discovered website development.
				            I learned the ropes of Ruby on Rails and MySQL, programming a CRUD-based website; although it was simple and plain,
				            coding from scratch offered me a unique satisfaction. I continued my web development pursuits and picked up Laravel, PHP,
				            and Angular.js throughout freshman year and into the summer. Additionally, the Code Ignite lessons I taught on game design
				            at John Early Middle inspired me to program my own 2D platformer game with Unity2D.

										<h5>Co-Founder & CMO</h5>
										<p>
											As a co-founder and the CMO, I seek to attract creative programmers, designers, and developers to the organization, as well as to recruit sympathetic organizations to contribute to and collaborate with Change++. Currently, I help our four teams interface with our participating non-profit organizations. I cannot wait to see the impact that Change++ will have on our community and beyond.

									<h5>Team Leader</h5>
									<p>
									I teach programming lessons in MIT Scratch block-coding to over 40 inner-city students after school hours
									weekly at John Early Magnet Middle School and Bellevue Prep Middle School. As a team leader, I instruct a team
									of three other programming teachers on how to profess weekly lessons to students in a constructive and interactive manner.
									As a group, we provide one-on-one assistance to students during independent programming time and lecture the classrooms as a whole.

									<h5>Corporation Liaison</h5>
									<p>
									As Liaison, I organize technology talks and events with STEM faculty regarding their different areas of scientific study,
									collaborate with various STEM-related student organizations on campus, such as National Society of Black Engineers, Women in Computing, to promote minority involvement in computer science
									I have also organized a joint event for Capital One at general body meeting centered around a tech talk and recruitment. VandyApps remains one of my favorite involvements on campus because
									of the positive effect is has had on the student body's programming knowledge base.
